## TL;DR on how to contribute:

2. create a new branch in your repo to submit changes (important, don't submit your PR from master).
3. make your changes with the in-browser editor,
4. and submit a pull request with a brief description so I can merge them back.
5. you might get a request for modifications

Please avoid adding new columns or modifying the tiers. This should be a simple table for tier price comparison. If you add a provider, remember to add it to the list above with a link to the pricing page.

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, I will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the awesome-* list guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.
